# What We Did

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
What We Did was written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) using the [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com/) library. It was designed and built with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com) in GameMaker over 48 hours for the 2015 Global Game Jam at the Institute of Digital Games site in Malta. The game contains various creative commons sound effects and pieces of music which are attributed in detail in its press (when I revive it).

What We Did was covered by [Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/what-we-did-asks-you-sympathize-criminals-plight/), [Warp Door](http://wip.warpdoor.com/2015/02/03/what-we-did-pippin-barr-rilla-khaled/), and [Rock, Paper, Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/pippin-barr/).
